## Summary
This project is part of Codecademy's [Full-Stack](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) and [Back-End](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/back-end-engineer-career-path) Engineer career paths. The simple project is meant to give practice in JavaScript, Version Control (GitHub), and command line.

## Project Instructions
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

### Project Objectives:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use command line
* Develop locally on your computer
### Prerequisites:
* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub
* Command line

## Program Detail
For this project, I decided to make my random message a "post-work plan". This will include:
* a chore to complete around the apartment
* what dinner to have
* a video game to play
I made three arrays with a list of options to do. My function then takes these arrays, chooses a random index for each, and prints to the console a plan for the user.
